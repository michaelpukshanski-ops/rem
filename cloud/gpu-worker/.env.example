# - https://huggingface.co/pyannote/segmentation-3.0
HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Speaker Diarization
ENABLE_DIARIZATION=true
# Set to false to disable speaker diarization

# Whisper Configuration
WHISPER_MODEL=base
# Options: tiny, base, small, medium, large-v2, large-v3
# Larger models are more accurate but slower and require more VRAM

WHISPER_DEVICE=cuda
# Options: cuda, cpu
# Use 'cuda' for GPU acceleration, 'cpu' for CPU-only

WHISPER_COMPUTE_TYPE=float16
# Options: float16, int8, float32
# float16 is fastest on GPU, int8 for lower memory, float32 for CPU

# Worker Configuration

# Seconds to wait between SQS polls when queue is empty

MAX_MESSAGES=1
# Number of messages to process in parallel (be careful with GPU memory)

VISIBILITY_TIMEOUT=900
# SQS visibility timeout in seconds (should match Terraform config)

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
# Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
